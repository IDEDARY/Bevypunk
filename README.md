# Bevy Lunex Cyberpunk Example

A recreation of ***Cyberpunk 2077*** UI in ***Bevy*** using **Bevy-Lunex**. This repo is intended to showcase how to use Bevy-Lunex in more complicated manner.
Currently it doesn't use the most up-to-date practices, but it works. For the latest stuff look for examples folder in the original repository.

*Note: The development is still on-going, this example is NOT finished and is subject of change.*
