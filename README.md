# Bevy_Lunex Examples

!!! DISCLAIMER !!!
I do not own any of the assets used, they are all kitbashed from original Cyberpunk game.
They are used ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. I don't profit from their usage nor do I claim
any ownership of them.


!! THIS REPO IS NOT A RELEASE OF BEVY_LUNEX !!
It is work in progress only for people who want to peak at the workflow of Bevy_Lunex.
There is a lot left unfinished and features are subject to change. Do NOT use yet.


For these brave souls, here is my current code... Feedback is appriciated.
Note: I know there are some dumb code solutions. I commented on them. They are temporary, I moved my focus to more important things. Don't worry, I will do something about it.
