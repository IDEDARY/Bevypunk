# Bevy Lunex Cyberpunk Example

A recreation of ***Cyberpunk 2077*** UI in ***Bevy***. It aligns SpriteBundles to values returned from Bevy-Lunex achieving AAA level layout capabilites and modularity. This repo is intended to be used as a study material for the ***by the book*** use case of Bevy-Lunex.

*Note: The development is still on-going, this example is NOT finished and is subject of change.*
